# Slim Setup

Go inside Docker to container /var/www/html directory and run 

        composer create-project slim/slim-skeleton app

**Note:** that if you use other name for the app than "app", you have to change that to the Dockerfile and rebuild the image.

Exit container and give rights to your user

        chown -R user:group *

Allow writing to monolog directory

        chmod a+w /var/www/html/app/logs/app.log


# Notes

- Todo: ? Move app and document root one level down to /var/www/app/public ??
